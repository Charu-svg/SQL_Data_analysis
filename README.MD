# Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis

This project demonstrates basic SQL data analysis operations using the **ecommerce.db** SQLite database. The goal is to practice extracting, analyzing, and manipulating data using SQL.

---

## 📌 **Project Overview**

The task includes writing SQL queries to:

* Select and filter data using `SELECT`, `WHERE`
* Sort data using `ORDER BY`
* Group and aggregate using `GROUP BY`, `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`
* Use joins (`INNER JOIN`) to combine tables
* Write subqueries
* Create views for analysis
* Create indexes to optimize performance

---

## 📁 **Deliverables**

You must submit:

### ✅ **1. SQL File**

A file named **task3_queries.sql** containing all SQL queries used in the project.

### ✅ **2. Screenshots of Query Outputs**

Screenshots showing the output of each query executed in VS Code or any SQL tool.
